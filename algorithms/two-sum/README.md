# Two sum

## Description

You will be given an array and a target sum and your goal is to find all pairs 
in the given array that add up to the target sum.  

## Implementation

**_twoSum(numArray, sum)_** should return every pair of numbers from _numArray_ that adds up to the _sum_.  
  
There are some conditions:
>   - result should be an array of arrays.
>   - any number in the _numArray_ can be used in multiple pairs.

For example:

```
twoSum([1, 6, 4, 5, 3, 3], 7) // [ [6, 1], [3, 4], [3, 4] ]
```
