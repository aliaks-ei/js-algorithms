# Reverse array in place

## Description

You will be given an array and your goal is to reverse it.  
  
## Implementation

**_reverseArrayInPlace(arr)_** should return the origin ```arr``` reversed.

There are some conditions:
>   - be sure to manipulate the array passed in.
>   - don't push elements into a new array and return that array.
>   - don't use _array.reverse()_ method.

For example:

```
reverseArrayInPlace([1, 2, 6, 3, 5, 0]) // [0, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1]
```
