# Mean, median, mode

## Description

You will be given an array of numbers and your goal is to return an object with 3 parameters:

   - **_mean_** - the _"average"_ number found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points.
   - **_median_** - the _middle_ number found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers).
   - **_mode_** - the most _frequent_ data point(s) (the data point(s) that occurs the highest number of times).

## Implementation

**_meanMedianMode(array)_** should return an object with _mean_, _median_ and _mode_ parameters of the given ```array```.

There are some conditions:
>   - you should create 3 separate functions to define every parameter (**_getMean()_**, **_getMedian()_**, **_getMode()_**).
>   - **_getMode()_** should return an array (even if only 1 number occurs the highest number of times).
>   - **_meanMedianMode()_** should call 3 functions described above.

For example:

```
meanMedianMode([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 1]) // { mean: 3.25, median: 3.5, mode: [1, 4] }
```
