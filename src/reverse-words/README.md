# Reverse words

## Description

You will be given a string and your goal is to reverse every word in it.  

## Implementation

**_reverseWords(string)_** should return the origin ```string``` with every word reversed.

There are some conditions:
>   - every word should be reversed but the string as a whole should not be reserved.
>   - don't use _array.reverse()_ method.

For example:

```
reverseWords('This is a string of words') // 'sihT si a gnirts fo sdrow'
```
