# Fibonacci

## Description

Explanation of the _Fibonacci_ sequence you can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

> NOTE: it's the simplest version of the algorithm and will exceed maximum call stack size in case of large _position_
given (i.e. 50).

## Implementation

**_fibonacci(position)_** should return a number on given ```position``` from _Fibonacci_ sequence.

For example:

```
fibonacci(9) // 34
```
