# Fibonacci

## Description

Explanation of the _Fibonacci_ sequence you can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

> NOTE: it's the simplest version of the algorithm and will exceed maximum call stack size in case of large _position_
given (i.e. 50).

## Implementation

`fibonacci(position)` should return a number on given `position` from _Fibonacci_ sequence.

Example:

```
fibonacci(9) // 34
```
