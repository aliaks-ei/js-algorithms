# Caesar cipher

## Description

_Caesar cipher_ is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Implementation

`caesarCipher(str, num)` should shift every letter in a given `str` by a `num` (positions down the alphabet).

Example:

```
caesarCipher('Zoo Keeper', 2) // 'Bqq Mggrgt'
```
